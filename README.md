# ANGRY_BOXES
This project is an AR game developed in Unity3D for the CSE462 Augmented Reality course. It lets players interact with virtual 3D objects in real-world space using their mobile camera. Players can choose different box types in the AR scene and shoot spheres to knock them down, blending physics and interactivity.

The application demonstrates the following core features:

- 🧱 **Stationary Virtual 3D Object**: A fixed virtual object appears over a tracked image target.
- 🖼️ **Image Mapping**: A virtual object maps and displays a user-provided picture.
- 🧩 **Three-Step Interactive Scenario**: A mini-scenario where users interact sequentially with virtual elements.
- 🖱️ **Virtual Object Selection**: At least two distinct interactions where users select virtual objects.
- 📲 **Scenario Switch via Buttons**: Two UI buttons are included for toggling between AR scenarios.
