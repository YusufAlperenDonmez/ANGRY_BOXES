# ANGRY_BOXES
This project is an AR game developed in Unity3D for the CSE462 Augmented Reality course. It lets players interact with virtual 3D objects in real-world space using their mobile camera. Players can choose different box types in the AR scene and shoot spheres to knock them down, blending physics and interactivity.
